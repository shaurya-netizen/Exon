# Exon - AI Content Strategy Engine

This repository contains the backend code for the Exon project, a hackathon entry.

## Project Description

Exon is an AI-powered platform that acts as a content co-pilot. It takes a user's goal and target audience, analyzes real-time data from YouTube and Reddit, and generates a complete, professional 30-day content strategy.

### **Live Frontend Website**

The user interface was built with Builder.io and is hosted live.

### **Technical Approach**

* **Frontend:** Built and hosted on Builder.io (React-based).
* **Backend:** A Node.js serverless function hosted on Vercel.
* **AI/NLP:** Google's Gemini API for analysis, simulation, and strategy synthesis.
* **Data Sources:** Official APIs for YouTube and Reddit.

##The Project is not working right now because the API requests are not being executed and the cloud billing of google is not responding due to which APIs are not responding.We have added a static prototype website which shows our vision going forward and with API implementation we will further improve our site##
